In this implementation, each process is responsible for processing a portion of the graph. We use the queue module to maintain a list of vertices to be processed, and the visited array to keep track of which vertices have been visited. We use the MPI.Allgather function to share the visited array between processes and ensure that all processes have the same information. We also use MPI.Barrier to synchronize the processes.

To analyze the speedup and efficiency of this algorithm on a cluster, we can measure the execution time of the algorithm for different numbers of processes, and compare it to the execution time on a single process. We can also calculate the speedup and efficiency as follows:

//makefile

speedup = single_process_execution_time / parallel_execution_time
efficiency = speedup / number_of_processes
Here's an example script to measure the execution time and speedup:

//makefile

import time

start_time = time.time()
# run the parallel BFS code
end_time = time.time()

parallel_execution_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Parallel execution time: {parallel_execution_time} seconds")

start_time = time.time()
# run the single process BFS code
end_time = time.time()

single_process_execution_time = end_time - start_time
print(f"Single process execution time: {single_process_execution_time} seconds")

speedup = single_process_execution_time / parallel_execution_time
efficiency = speedup / size
print(f"Speedup: {speedup}")
