One randomized algorithm for the Minimum Cut Problem is the Karger-Stein algorithm, which has an expected running time of O(n^2 log n), 
where n is the number of vertices in the graph.

The Karger-Stein algorithm works by iteratively contracting randomly chosen edges in the graph until only two nodes remain. 
The resulting cut corresponds to the edges that were contracted in the final step. To improve the accuracy of the algorithm, 
the contraction process is repeated multiple times and the minimum cut over all iterations is returned.

To implement the Karger-Stein algorithm, we can start with an undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.
Then, we perform the following steps:

Repeat the contraction process log n times.
Randomly select an edge to contract from the graph.
Contract the selected edge by merging the nodes at its endpoints into a single node.
Remove any self-loops created by the contraction.
Repeat steps 2-4 until only two nodes remain.
At the end of the log n iterations, the algorithm returns the minimum cut found over all iterations.

The expected running time of the Karger-Stein algorithm is O(n^2 log n), which is relatively efficient compared to other algorithms 
for the Minimum Cut Problem. The algorithm has an approximation ratio of at least 1/2, which means that the minimum cut found by the 
algorithm is at most twice the size of the actual minimum cut.
