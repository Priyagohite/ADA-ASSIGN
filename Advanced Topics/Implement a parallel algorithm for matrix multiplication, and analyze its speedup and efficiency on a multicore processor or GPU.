To analyze the speedup and efficiency of the Cannon's algorithm, we can measure the execution time of the algorithm on different numbers of processors and compare them with the execution time of the sequential algorithm. We can also calculate the speedup and efficiency using the following formulas:

Speedup = Sequential time / Parallel time
Efficiency = Speedup / Number of processors

Here is an example of measuring the execution time and calculating the speedup and efficiency on a multicore processor using the MPI implementation
