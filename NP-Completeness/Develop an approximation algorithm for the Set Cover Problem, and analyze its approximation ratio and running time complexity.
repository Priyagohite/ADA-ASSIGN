The Set Cover Problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science that involves finding the minimum number of sets (from a given collection of sets) needed to cover all the elements in a universe. The problem is known to be NP-hard, which means that it is unlikely to have an efficient algorithm that always produces an optimal solution.

One common approach to solve the Set Cover Problem is to use an approximation algorithm, which produces a solution that is guaranteed to be within a certain factor of the optimal solution. Here, we will discuss a simple greedy algorithm that provides an approximation ratio of ln(n), where n is the number of elements in the universe. This means that the solution produced by the algorithm is guaranteed to be at most ln(n) times the size of the optimal solution.

The algorithm works as follows:

Initialize an empty set C, which will contain the selected sets.
While there are still uncovered elements in the universe, do the following:
a. Select the set Si that covers the most uncovered elements.
b. Add Si to C.
c. Remove all elements covered by Si from the universe.
The running time complexity of the algorithm is O(mn), where m is the number of sets in the collection. This is because in the worst case, we need to iterate over all the sets for each element in the universe. However, in practice, the algorithm often runs much faster than this worst-case bound.

To analyze the approximation ratio of the algorithm, let OPT be the size of the optimal solution and let S be the solution produced by the algorithm. We need to show that:

|S| <= ln(n) * OPT

To prove this, we can use the following lemma:

Lemma: For any positive integer k, ln(k) >= 1 - 1/k.

Proof: Let f(x) = ln(x) - 1 + 1/x. Taking the derivative of f(x), we get:

f'(x) = 1/x - 1/(x^2)

Setting f'(x) = 0, we get x = 1, which is a local minimum. Therefore, f(x) >= f(1) = 0, which implies ln(x) >= 1 - 1/x.

Using this lemma, we can show that:

OPT <= sum_i=1^m |Si|

<= sum_i=1^m log(n/|Si|) * |Si| (since |Si| <= n)

<= log(n) * sum_i=1^m |Si| - sum_i=1^m |Si| * log(|Si|/n)

<= log(n) * OPT - sum_i=1^m |Si| * log(|Si|/n)

Now, let S' be the solution produced by the algorithm. We know that each set Si in S' covers at least 1/e fraction of the remaining uncovered elements, since otherwise,
the algorithm would have selected a different set. Therefore, we can show that:

sum_i=1^m |Si| * log(|Si|/n) >= sum_i=1^m (1/e) * log(n) * |Si| = (log(n)/e) * sum_i=1^m |Si|

Combining this with the previous inequality, we get:

OPT <= log(n) * OPT - (log(n)/e) * OPT

OPT/e <= |S'| <= ln(n) * OPT

Therefore, the approximation ratio of the algorithm is ln(n), which is a logarithmic factor of the size of the universe. 
This is a good approximation ratio for many practical instances of the Set Cover Problem, and the algorithm is simple to implement and has a reasonable running time complexity.
