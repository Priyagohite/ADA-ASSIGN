  To compare the performance of the tabu search algorithm to that of a greedy algorithm, we can generate a set of random graphs and measure the quality of the solutions found by each algorithm on each graph. Here's a possible experiment:

Generate a set of 50 random graphs, each with 100 nodes and an average degree of 10. You can use a library like NetworkX to generate the graphs.
For each graph, run the tabu search algorithm and the greedy algorithm, and record the best solution found by each algorithm (i.e., the number of cut edges).
Plot the distribution of the best solutions found by each algorithm, and compare them using summary statistics like the mean, median, and standard deviation.
